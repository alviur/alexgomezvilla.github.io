## Brief Bio
I grew up in Colombia, studied electrical engineering at [University of Antioquia](http://www.udea.edu.co/), was awarded a [RETECA swiss scholarship](http://www.supsi.ch/international_en/students/incoming-students/reteca.html) at [SUPSI](http://www.supsi.ch/) university where I obtained a M.Sc. on engineering.

Currently, I am doing my PhD at [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/) under the supervision of professors Marcelo Bertalmio and Jesus Malo. My main research interest is on linking artificial neural networks with vision models. More in detail, to develop artificial models capable of reproducing the human visual perception and thought these models close the gap between computational neuroscience, visual science, and computer vision fields.

I was under the supervision of:
Professor Igor Stefanini and professor Augusto Salazar.
